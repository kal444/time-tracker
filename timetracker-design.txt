Time tracker design

Tasks table
Id, task name, archived, timestamps (created, updated, last used,
inactivated), system entered, max minutes to spend in one sitting, use
count?, round up to nearest x,
Row 1 is idle time

Categories table
Id, category name, archived

Entries table
Id, task id, start time, end time, duration in mins exact, parsed
year, duration rounded up

Categorized tasks table (m to m)
Task id, category Id

User actions
Starting the app for the first time - create an idle entry and start it
Start a task, from idle to a selected task
End a task, from current task to idle
Switch to a task, from current task to a selected task

Report to google doc or a csv file on dropbox or just the file system
on android.

Crud on tasks
Crud on categories
Adding categories to a task
Crud on entries
Notification when entry is at max time

Wish list
Graph of time used by category or task
Totals by week, month, year, etc.
Templates for a regular week (how to do templates intuitively?) need
notifications too
Centralized server for this?
Create widget on android?

Questions
In app ad on android? Not sure if this really works that well. Mostly
expect the user to be using the widget
Integrate with locale on android?
How to resolve ongoing task vs. A template task?
